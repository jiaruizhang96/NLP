never heard of the comic so i bought this from just watching the online trailer i dont think this was even close to being the worst horror movie of all time i can easily think of  others that actually made me angry that i sat all the way through them i had fun from start to finish it had the perfect balance of comedy and horror too much horror and it would have come across as taking itself too seriously too much comedy and it would have just been stupid like scary movie this movie did not feel at all like the garbage that distributors slap onto shelves just to make a quick buck with no regard to what the consumer wants i can see the effort put into this movie it didnt feel as cheap as i was expecting i had a few good laughs and grooved on the gore fun and twisted and kept my attention i dont regret buying it to add to my collection of offthewall movies which does not include hatchet because that is a truly awful movie that i put through my shredder,3,9017066,1,-0.025833333,0.595

first i would like to note that the statue pictured on the package design as well as here on the website is not the actual statue but a photo of the full size version offered through dc direct the sculpt is different as jokers head is tilted to the left instead of looking straight ahead however even though the advertisement for this product is a bit misleading in that sense i did go on ahead and purchase it as an early christmas present to myself i am not disappointed in this statue at all as i believe it was well worth the reasonable price tag and alot of detail and attention was put into its design this statue will make a perfect addition to any batman collection and i was pleased to see that best buy offered this statue to its customers through the website until it was sold out great product would highly recommend to any joker fan,4.5,8946929,1,0.313823529,0.5442997

this is one of the best career documentaries i have ever seen completely rivals and can stand nextto the last waltz i was completely impressed by the willingness of director peter bogdanovitch to keep himself out of it and allow tom petty to tell his own story petty shows a willingness to reveal his strengths weaknesses his mistakes and above all his love of the music also evident was the importance of his vision to keep the band as one cohesive unit which explains their lasting thirty years together the included interviews and comments with other musicians such as eddie vedder gives a real glimpse of the respect for pettys contribution to musicbr the accompanying th anniversary concert dvd and songmix cd are added bonuses that will be enjoyed over and over i truly felt after watching and listening that tom petty was having as much fun as i was probably morebr best buy gets kudos for offering this gem and their shipping time was excellent as usual this belongs in your archives,5,8539575,1,0.321984552,0.513153595
